This site is intended to track bugs **and** feature-request for Google services and products. There is absolutely no guarantee that Google will fix these bugs or even look at them. Go to http://www.google.com/support/ before you submit a bug here. And most importantly: star issues which you want fixed, this will give a reddit-like measurement of which issues are important.

Quick rules
1. Go to http://www.google.com/support/ for real support. There you can find discussion groups and contact forms to submit bug reports directly to Google.
2. This is **not** a support group, go to the corresponding Google Group to discuss any problem you might have.
3. This is **not** an official bug tracker from Google, they might never read these bug reports.
4. Do **not** add bugs for the software which runs this issue tracker (Google Project Hosting), add those to http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/list
5. Search for your bug first, star the bug if you found it and add more information if necessary.
6. If you get an error message from google type it in completely in the bug report.
